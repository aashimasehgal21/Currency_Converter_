This project is a simple Currency Converter that predicts the exchange rate from USD to EUR using historical exchange rate data. It leverages a basic linear regression model trained on past exchange rates to estimate future currency values. The entire tool is implemented in Python, without any web development components, making it easy to run and use locally.


What the Project Does and How It Works

Data Preparation: Historical exchange rate data is cleaned and preprocessed by converting dates into numerical values suitable for machine learning models.

Model Training :A linear regression model is trained to understand the relationship between dates and corresponding exchange rates.

Exchange Rate Prediction: The trained model predicts the USD to EUR exchange rate for any given date input by the user.

Visualization: The project includes a visualization component that plots historical exchange rates and the modelâ€™s predicted trend line, helping users see how well the model fits the data.
